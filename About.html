      <h3>ABOUT</h3>
      <p>
        Coldplay are a British rock band formed in London in 1997. They consist
        of vocalist and pianist Chris Martin, guitarist Jonny Buckland, bassist
        Guy Berryman, drummer Will Champion and manager Phil Harvey.

        Coldplay’s full-length debut Parachutes (2000) sold millions on the
        strength of Martin’s vocals and such singles as the bittersweet
        “Yellow.” Parachutes earned the band its first Grammy Award, for best
        alternative album, and paved the way for the more ambitious A Rush of
        Blood to the Head (2002). The latter album earned the group two more
        Grammy Awards, and singles such as “Clocks” helped drive the band’s
        total album sales over the 20 million mark. Coldplay followed the
        concert album Live 2003 (2003) with X & Y (2005), a collection of
        guitar-driven, arena-friendly rock anthems (including the hit single
        “Speed of Sound”) that elevated the group to the rank of such “big
        bands” as U2 and Radiohead. Meanwhile, Martin’s 2003–16 marriage to
        American actress Gwyneth Paltrow earned him celebrity status independent
        of his musical achievements.

        The band’s 2008 release, Viva la Vida, produced in part by Brian Eno,
        topped the charts in the United States and the United Kingdom, and the
        album’s title track, arguably Coldplay’s most radio-friendly effort yet,
        was the number one single on both sides of the Atlantic. That popularity
        was reflected at the 2009 Grammy Awards ceremony, where the band
        collected honours for song of the year, best rock album, and best pop
        performance by a group. Working again with Eno, Coldplay returned with
        the sleek Mylo Xyloto (2011), which notably featured a duet between
        Martin and pop singer Rihanna. Later releases included the subdued Ghost
        Stories (2014), which yielded the hit singles “Magic” and “A Sky Full of
        Stars”; the upbeat A Head Full of Dreams (2015); and the EP Kaleidoscope
        (2017). To mark the release of Everyday Life (2019), Coldplay performed
        two live-streamed concerts, one at sunrise and the other at sunset, in
        Amman, Jordan. In 2021 Music of the Spheres appeared, and it became the
        band’s ninth consecutive studio album to reach the top spot of the
        British album chart.
